## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam and microphone
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the App

1. Start the Streamlit server:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. The app will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

3. Click the **START** button to begin streaming

4. Allow camera and microphone permissions when prompted

## üéØ How to Use

### For Video Calls

1. Open the app in your browser
2. Click **START** to begin your video stream
3. Share the URL with others you want to call
4. They open the same URL in their browser
5. Both parties will see each other's video feeds

### Testing Locally

To test the app by yourself:
- Open the app URL in two different browser tabs, OR
- Use one normal window and one incognito/private window
- Click START in both windows
- You'll see yourself in both windows when connected

### Available Modes

- **Video Call**: Full video and audio streaming
- **Audio Only**: Voice call without video
- **Video Only (No Audio)**: Video streaming without audio

## üîß Configuration

### Video Settings

Adjust settings in the sidebar:
- **Mirror my video**: Flip your video horizontally
- **Video Quality**: Adjust quality from 10% to 100%

### Advanced Options

The app uses Google's STUN servers by default for NAT traversal. You can modify the RTC configuration in `app.py` if needed.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Video not working?

- Ensure your browser has camera/microphone permissions
- Try using Chrome or Edge browser (best WebRTC support)
- Check if other applications are using your camera
- Refresh the page and try again

### Connection issues?

- Use a wired internet connection for better stability
- Close bandwidth-heavy applications
- Check your firewall settings

### Windows-specific issues?

If you see asyncio errors in the console, they're usually non-fatal. The app should still work. If problems persist:
- Try using a different browser
- Update your dependencies: `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`

## üì¶ Dependencies

Main packages used:
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **streamlit-webrtc**: WebRTC integration for Streamlit
- **aiortc**: Python WebRTC implementation
- **PyAV**: Audio/video processing
- **OpenCV**: Image processing

See `requirements.txt` for the complete list.

## üîí Security & Privacy

- All video/audio streams use **peer-to-peer connections**
